1.9.36.1.2 Field: Surface Type
The choices for Surface Type are Window, Door, GlassDoor, TubularDaylightDome, and Tubular-
DaylightDiffuser. Doors are assumed to be opaque (do not transmit solar radiation) whereas the other
surface types do transmit solar radiation. Windows and Glass Doors are treated identically in the calculation
of conduction heat transfer, solar gain, daylighting, etc. A Window or GlassDoor, but not a Door,
can have a movable interior, exterior or between-glass shading device, such as blinds (ref: WindowMaterial:
Blind object), and can have a frame and/or a divider (ref: WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider object).
TubularDaylightDomes and TubularDaylightDomes are specialized subsurfaces for use with the DaylightingDevice:
Tubular object to simulate Tubular Daylighting Devices (TDDs). TubularDaylightDomes and
TubularDaylightDomes cannot have shades, screens or blinds. In the following, the term ÅgwindowÅh applies
to Window, GlassDoor, TubularDaylightDome, and TubularDaylightDome, if not otherwise explicitly
mentioned.
As noted in the description of the BuildingSurface:Detailed, Azimuth (facing angle) and Tilt are calculated
from the entered vertices. Tilts of subsurfaces will normally be the same as their base surface. If
these are significantly beyond the ÅgnormalsÅh for the base surface, warning messages may be issued. If the
facing angles are not correct, you may have a window pointing ÅgintoÅh the zone rather than out of it . this
would cause problems in the calculations. Note, too, that a ÅgrevealÅh (inset or outset) may occur if the
plane of the subsurface is not coincident with the base surface; the reveal has an effect on shading of the
subsurface.
